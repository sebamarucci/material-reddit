# material-reddit

Demo application that shows the top 50 reddit posts. Built in React using Material UI, Redux and React Router.

The React Project was created using [nwb](https://github.com/insin/nwb), which helps to quickly set up a project by providing a zero-config development setup.

The application was built using React 16.9.0, using only functions and React Hooks. There are no React classes.

Material UI provides OOTB responsive design, allowing the application to be correctly displayed in computers, tablets and cellphones.

The state of the application is stored in Redux and the routing is handled by React Router.

Unit tests are built using Jest and React Testing Library.
